1. Add causal mask for attention 
2. Add weight tying ???????
3. Use beam search
4. Use V100 to train, it is much faster than P100
6. BCELoss makes the model run much slower?????
7. Separate layernorm??
8. Rebuild the tokenzier and clean the report
9. INcrease max_length
10. Use contrastive loss?? -> No?
11. Add (1-lambda_init)
12. Check really hard the cleaning and tokenizing 
13. smaller topk?
14. Change visual extractor
15. maybe use a pretrained decoder for better caption
Ways to get better:
-Clean report
-Use beam search
-Change or fix binary classifier
-Tuning learning rate/delta
