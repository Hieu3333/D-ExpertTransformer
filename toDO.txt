1. Add causal mask for attention 
2. Add weight tying ???????
3. Use beam search
4. Use V100 to train, it is much faster than P100
5. The test branch has much faster eval and test time but horrible result???

Ways to get better:
-Clean report
-Use beam search
-Change or fix binary classifier
-Tuning learning rate/delta
